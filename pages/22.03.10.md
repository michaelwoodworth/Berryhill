# Command Line Basics

This week, we mostly touched on basics of shell (bash) scripting, common commands, and for loops.  To have a sense of what we were working with, we also prepped assemblies for four publicly-available *S. aureus* genomes.

## Unix Shell Computing
(Adapted from [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/))

Shell syntax is:
- case sensitive
- flexible to absolute or relative paths
- can often be auto-completed with tab
- 

commands
``` console
ls
pwd
/
*
?
.
..
clear
man
--help
cd
cd ..
cd -
cd ~
mkdir
rm
```

### General command syntax

`ls` is the **command**, with **option** `-l` and an **argument** `/`.

### Naming files and directories

- Spaces aren't allowed
- Common to use `CamelHumpLettering`, `Underscore_delimited_names`, or `period.delimited.names`
- Extensions don't have special meaning in Unix

### Editing files in command line

``` console
mkdir 99.lists
cd 99.lists
nano 22.03.10-SRA_IDs.txt
```

Nano commands
- `Ctrl + o`: save
- `Ctrl + x`: quit
- `Ctrl + x`: line number

Other file-manipulation commands
``` console
touch
mv
cp
rename
rm -i
cat
echo
>
>>
less
more
head
tail
history
wc
|
chmod
ln
which
```

### Managing jobs

``` console
free
top
ps
jobs
kill
&
fg
```
