# Files & For Loops

Week 2 goals are to develop an intuition for what should be in sequence files (FASTQ/FASTA), working with for loops, use of tmux, and assembly.

## Sequence Files

The most common file format of sequence files are FASTQ or FASTA. This format can be abbreviated as a number of different equivalent suffices (e.g. fq, fastq, fa, fna, etc)

**FASTQ** files: contain four file lines per read.
1. @${READ ID}
2. Sequence (TTTTGTTTTTCTTCTCATTATTATTT...)
3. +${READ ID}
4. Quality (AAAA1CFFFACFGEGE3BF3BF3DGG...)

**FASTA** files: contain two file lines per read.
1. >${READ ID}
2. Sequence (TTTTGTTTTTCTTCTCATTATTATTT...)
